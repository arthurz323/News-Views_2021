    [Why comfort food is hard to resist? Is food choice only a matter of "will power" or it has physiological basis?] 
    Excessive consumption of high-calorie processed food is the main cause of obesity. Though the impact of obesity to the brain is unclear, evidence has pointed out that chronic high-calorie diet alters ventral pallidum (VP), a structure relates to feeding behaviour in the reward system, in mice. Specifically, Gendelis et al. found that: 1) chronic high-fat-high-sugar (HFHS) diet changes the neuronal properties in VP; 2) VP neurons become less active in mice which have gained the most weight; 3) weight-gaining in general relates to weakened ability to suppress inhibitory input, which leads to inactivity of VP and promotes overeating in turn; interestingly, 4) between naive-to-HFHS-food mice with the highest and lowest level of food seeking behaviour, similar pattern of difference seen in 3) is also presented, implying that variation in the ability of inhibitory input suppression maybe innate. These results suggested that VP is critical to chronic high-calorie diet induced obesity, and its innate property...may determine the level of obesity resistance... better understanding the role of reward system & obesity...intervene obesity epidemic...
    
    
    (chronic high-calorie diet does alter the reward system; by shutting down VP, the lateral hypothalamus more active...?), further identify its role in future studies is essential. [132 words, more!!!!]
    
    
    *4) in mice that are naive to HFHS food, similar pattern of difference seen in 3) was also found between mice demonstrated the highest and lowest level of food seeking behaviour, implying that variation in the ability of inhibitory input suppression maybe innate.
    
    *4) differences in the ability of inhibitory input suppression (VP) was also found between groups that displayed difference in food seeking level, with the highest seeker  also found in mice that are naive to HFHS food, some individuals difference in food seeking  in which implies that the ability of inhibitory input suppression maybe innate.*
    
    
    
    1. naive to HFHS
    2. high & low level of food seeking
    3. difference in the ability of inhibitory input suppression has the same pattern found between HFHS & chow 
    4. implying that the ability of inhibitory input suppression maybe innate
    


# Main (~1000):

0. what motivate me to write about this paper???
    keywords: palatable food, accessibility, healthy diet (how to define), unhealthy diet (how to define), obesity (worldwide issue)
Q1: comparing HFHS & control, what will HFHS do to VP? any difference between groups?

Q2: within HFHS, difference in weight-gaining have difference in VP neurophysiology?
    Q2.1 electrophysiology
    Q2.2 synaptic plasticity
    
Q3: if Q1 or Q2=true, are neuronal difference (among different amount of weight-gaining) due to diet, or innateness plays a role? i.e., quote: "are these synaptic differences between obesity-prone and obesity-resistant animals the cause or the consequence of obesity?"
    
    
1. introduce the (existing) problem the article tackled
    1.1 relatable example (e.g.,):
        1.1.1 Recall the last time you had "comfort food"/doughnut/fried chicken/chocolate/candy, craving! Why? Not that you need them to keep you alive,but it makes you feel good.
    
    Processed food is usually attractive and appetising yet calorie-dense; its accessibility promotes overeating and drives obesity in turn. Despite the high prevalence of obesity worldwide, the neurological mechanisms are poorly understood. Previous studies demonstrated that diet-induced obesity share similar properties with addiction: both may involve pathologies in the reward system (ref.). Therefore, in order to dissect the impact of diet-induced obesity on the reward system, a crucial area in the reward system which also modulates feeding behaviour (ref.), ventral pallidum (VP), has been put forward. Writing in *the Journal of Neuroscience*, Gendelis et al. (2020) found that chronic high-calorie diet changes VP neuron physiology and metaplasticity (change in the direction or degree of synaptic plasticity; Abraham, 1996), with the differences in the latter regime being innate.
    
    also contributes to the weight-gaining.
    
    its role in obesity remains unknown...
    
    
    
        * in 2016, over 650 million adults were obese, and over 340 million children & adolescents were overweight or obese (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight), and obesity-related diseases have become leading cause of death worldwide.
        
        1.1.2 (or) Why doughnut/fried chicken/chocolate/candy are hard to resist?
        
        1.1.3 (or) Does food choice only about "will power" or there are actual/physiological changes in your brain? i.e., gaining weight is just bc one lacks "will power"?
    
    1.2 high-calorie diet esp. processed palatable food are easily accessible, induced obesity, which is a pressing problem (give WHO data here)
    
    1.3 existing problem
        1.3.1 existing studies showed diet-induced obesity can change the brain, but where? what? how? unknown
        
        1.3.2 pointing to the reward system, similar to addiction, NAc esp., and introduce ventral pallidum (the fact that it relates to feeding! VP activation ⬆️, ➡️ feeding; it also encodes hedonistic values of the food), lack of study in this region
        
        1.3.3 Are some more likely to gain weight than others? i.e., some people are more susceptible to choose palatable food ( which leads to gain excessive weight) given the same diet? i.e., innate/personal difference?



2. introduce diet-induced obesity & its relationship with reward system, esp VP, its role in pathological overeating (*is the overeating here really pathological????) & obesity has not been studied
    2.1 gives rise to the pos. of involving growth factor in PD
    
    2.2 gradually reason to introducing growth factor into adult brain to treat PD



3. method in the article
    3.1 electrophysiology
    
    3.2 HFHS diet
    
    3.3 justification of choosing the method -> functionality/properties change at the neuronal level in VP from the difference in diet (mention chronic here!)
    
    
    
4. method in more detail (whole-cell patch clamp, voltage & current)
*excitatory synaptic transmission is #BLOCKED# by CNQX (AMPAR/kainate antagonist)!!!!* -> not looking at the glutamate at all!
* evoked IPSC (~30-70% of the max. IPSC) induced by a bipolar stimulating electrode anterior to the cell
* groups
    HFHS (10-12 weeks)
        WG (weight-gainer, upper 33%)
        NWG (not weight-gainer, lower 33%)
    chow
        HSe (high seeker for HFHS reward, upper 33%)
        LSe (low seeker for HFHS reward, lower 33%)

    4.1 current clamp: measures excitability & passive membrane properties
        4.1.1 current step protocol: injection of 500ms depolarising current 0pA-80pA (20pA step); baseline membrane potential adjusted to -50mV by injecting constant current
        
        * spontaneous IPSC recorded for 100s without stimulation
        
    4.2 voltage clamp: hold -80mV, measures synaptic activity
    
    4.3 HFS (high-frequency stimulation) induce plasticity (depression) 
        4.3.1 evoked IPSC baseline measurement (under voltage clamp -80mV), 3mins
        
        4.3.2 HFS: 100 stimulation at 100Hz, with amplitude equals to IPSC baseline, 2 trains separated by 20s
        
        4.3.3 after the 2nd train, voltage clamp -80mV, and record evoked (not spontaneous) IPSC at 0.1Hz, average amplitude of 6 responses to get one data point per minute
        
        4.3.4 short-term synaptic depression (STD): measure PTP (post-tetanic potentiation; a form of short-term plasticity, induces change in *frequency* of **miniature** post-synaptic current/potential but not amplitude) 1min after HFS
        
        4.3.5 long-term synaptic depression (LTD): measure ??? 13-19 min after HFS
        
    4.4 consecutive pulses*2 with 50ms interval
        4.4.1 PPR (paired-pulse ration): amplitude of second pulse/amplitude of first pulse (i.e., ratio of two amplitudes) for each group
        
        4.4.2 CV (coefficient of variation) of the current: difference between the first peak of two pulses
        
        4.4.3 these two parameters are measured twice: baseline & after HFS, repeated 20 times under each condition; they are indicators of change in the probability of *pre-synaptic* release

*[Something else: **The frequency of the mPSC is dependent upon vesicular release whereas the amplitude of the mPSC is dependent upon activation of the postsynaptic receptor. As an example, if you see a reduction in the frequency of mIPSCs, it is due to a decrease in the release of GABA, while a decrease in the amplitude of mIPSCs is due to reduced activation of postsynaptic GABAA receptors.**
    **"Spontaneous postsynaptic currents are currents generated by action-potential-dependent and –independent release of neurotransmitter in the absence of experimental stimulation. Miniature postsynaptic currents are currents observed in the absence of presynaptic action potentials; they are thought to correspond to the response that is elicited by a single vesicle of transmitter."

5. HFHS & Chow group (more method stuff which leads directly to the finding)
    5.1 passive neuronal properties (measured 2 weeks after HFHS)
        5.1.1 V_rest: HFHS ⬇️
        
        5.1.2 AP firing rate: HFHS ⬇️
        
        5.1.3 first-spike latency (FSL): no difference
        
        5.1.4 AP waveform: HFHS wider
            AP half-width ⬆️
            AP rise time ⬆️
            membrane resistance ⬆️
            current injected to maintain at -50mV ⬇️ (i.e., closer to -50mV, tho still >-50mV)
    ➡️ chronic HFHS changed VP neuron physiology

    5.2 GABA transmission
        5.2.1 spontaneous IPSC amplitude: HFHS ⬇️
        
        5.2.2 spontaneous IPSC frequency: no difference
    ➡️ change in GABA transmission, less likely due to pre-synaptic properties change, since PPR & CV of evoked IPSC did not change
    
        5.2.3 evidence from synaptic plasticity (induced depression)
            a. STD (ms): 5 identical pulses (1Hz, 10Hz, 50Hz), record change (divide each evoked IPSC by the first one, i.e., ratio of IPSC_n/IPSC_1) in evoked IPSC; no difference in evoked IPSC frequency between groups
            ➡️ no STD induced
            
            b. LTD (min): used HFS protocol as above, no difference between groups
            ➡️ no LTD induced
    ➡️ chronic HFHS impairs spontaneous neurotransmission through a post-synaptic mechanism, yet it does NOT change STD & LTD of evoked GABA transmission
    
➡️ #BIG point 1: HFHS changes VP neuron physiology



6. WG & NWG (no difference in baseline weight)
    6.1 passive neuronal properties (measured 2 weeks after HFHS)
        6.1.1 V_rest: WG ⬇️; negatively correlated with weight-gaining across the *ENTIRE HFHS* group!!
        
        6.1.2 AP firing rate: no difference
        
        6.1.3 first-spike latency (FSL): WG ⬆️
        
        6.1.4 AP waveform: no difference
            AP rise time ⬆️
    ➡️ comparing to NWG, VP neurons in WG are more hyper-polarised & slower to fire AP, i.e., less excitatory
    
    6.2 synaptic plasticity
        6.2.1 spontaneous IPSC (amplitudes & frequency): no difference
        
        6.2.2 evoked IPSC (again HFS protocol; 10 & 50Hz)
            a. ST (ratio of IPSC_n/IPSC_1): WG ⬆️ (Fig. 4D)
            ➡️ STP (short-term potentiation!!) induced in WG
            
            b. LT (IPSC amplitude): WG ⬆️, lasted for ~15min; transient NWG ⬇️ but *non-sig*!!
            ➡️ LTP (long-term potentiation!!) induced in WG, and correlated with weight-gaining across *ALL MICE*!! Transforming from LTD in NWG & LTP in WG!!!

        6.2.3 PTP: WG > NWG ➡️ tendency of strengthening inhibitory input (i.e., getting more and more inactive)
        
➡️ #BIG point 2: comparing to NWG, VP neurons in WG has: 1. V_rest ⬇️, FSL ⬆️; 2. STP & LTP after HFS, while NWG has LTD; 3. reduction of V_rest inversely relates to weight-gaining across HFHS; 4. LTP relates weight-gaining across ALL MICE.



7. it is **weight-gaining** that matters to VP physiology, not weight-loss
    7.1 BUT! here comes the issue: measurement made after chronic HFHS & weight-gaining, and the weight-loss is dropping to the baseline, i.e., "back to normal" NOT pathological. thus, it is not weight-gaining or losing per say, but the whether it is pathological.
        quote: "*the physiology of the VP is **more linked** to the consumption of highly palatable food and not to the abstinence from it*" 

➡️ This does NOT sound feasible, as their weights are getting back to normal! Only assessing change of weight can NOT make such conclusion!



8. innateness of synaptic plasticity difference between WG & NWG
    8.1 parameters seeking: the thing changed by chronic diet change, but not HFHS itself ➡️ FSL & synaptic plasticity (SP)
    
    8.2 training chow mice (progression ratio task, reward is CHOW FOOD!)
        8.2.1 HSe (top 33%)
        
        8.2.2 LSe (bottom 33%)
    
    8.3 FSL & STSP: no difference; different from WG & NWG (see 6.1.3 & 6.2.2a)
    ➡️ differences in FSL & STSP are NOT innate, but induced by HFHS

    8.4 LTSP
        8.4.1 evoked IPSC amplitudes: HSe ⬆️, LSe ⬇️; i.e., *LTP in HSe, LTD in LSe*, *similar to WG & NWG results* (see 6.2.2b)
        
        8.4.2 LTSP lasted longer in seekers than after diet modification (HFHS & Chow), presumably bc HFHS already made the modification to VP, thus the effect of extra HFS has only limited impact (just a wild guess...)
        
    8.5 PTP: HSe > LSe, *similar to WG & NWG results* (see 6.2.3)

➡️ #BIG point 3: *proneness* to (HFS-induced) inhibitory input LTP to VP is an innate property that may partially be the cause of extreme weight gaining, i.e., VP are more likely to strengthen inhibitory input



9. summary
    9.1 HFHS & Chow
        9.1.1 passive membrane properties
        V_rest: HFHS ⬇️
        AP firing rate: HFHS ⬇️
        AP waveform: HFHS wider
        ➡️ chronic HFHS changed VP neuron physiology
        
        9.1.2 GABA neurotransmission
        spontaneous IPSC amplitude: HFHS ⬇️
        ➡️ change in GABA transmission, less likely due to pre-synaptic properties change but intrinsic changes in VP neuron itself
        
        9.1.3 SP
        ➡️ no STSP or LTSP
    ➡️ #BIG point 1: HFHS changes VP neuron physiology
    
    9.2 WG & NWG in HFHS
        9.1.1 passive membrane properties
        V_rest: WG ⬇️
        FSL: WG ⬆️
        ➡️ VP in WG became less active/excitatory
        
        9.1.2 SP
        STSP: STP in WG, i.e., evoked IPSC amplitude ⬆️
        LTSP: LTP in WG, & non-sig LTD in NWG (what matters is the direction); i.e., evoked IPSC amplitude ⬆️ lasted ~15mins
        PTP: WG > NWG        
        ➡️ STSP or LTSP
    ➡️ #BIG point 2: comparing to NWG, VP neurons in WG has: 1. V_rest ⬇️, FSL ⬆️; 2. STP & LTP after HFS, while NWG has LTD; 3. reduction of V_rest inversely relates to weight-gaining across HFHS; 4. LTP relates weight-gaining across ALL MICE.
    
    9.3 HSe & LSe test innateness
        9.3.1 differences in FSL & STSP are NOT innate but induced by HFHS
        
        9.3.2 difference in LTSP may be innate, as HSe & LSe demonstrated differences WITHOUT exposure to HFHS
        
        9.3.3 difference in PTP may also be innate
    ➡️ #BIG point 3: *proneness* to (HFS-induced) inhibitory input LTP to VP is an innate property that may partially be the cause of extreme weight gaining, i.e., VP are more likely to strengthen inhibitory input
    i.e., VP neurons play a role in weight-gaining, individual differences in VP neuron properties may results in different outcome



10. discussion
    10.1 mechanism
        10.1.1 amount of striatal D2 receptor ⬇️ in obese animals, & excitatory input to NAc ⬆️, ➡️ GABAergic input from NAc to VP ⬆️ in obese animals, ➡️ VP is stronger inhibited, ➡️ WG had LTP to GABAergic input
        
        10.1.2 LTD to GABAergic input may act as a compensation against hyperpolarisation in VP induced by HFHS diet, WG & HSe lack the ability to weaken the inhibitory input to VP, ➡️ they are more prone to become obese

    * collaboration between neuroscientists & Gastroenterologists, i.e., brain-gut axis
    
    * about the diet itself
        sugar (diabetes use high fat low sugar diet, its about the balance of insulin -> control carbs, i.e., free sugar) INSULIN RESISTANCE is the term!!
        what fat? saturated? unsaturated? trans?
        Pennetta lipid droplets, high fat diet improve ALS
        the combination of high sugar & fat rather than high fat contributes to obesity -> introduce HFLS, LFHS, LFLS groups, and specify the type of fat & sugar (free or complex?) -> specify the role of each component -> better translate to human diet design, & understanding of obesity & reward system
        terminology: "palatable"=HFHS??? isn't that too subjective????? maybe: difference also lies in food preference, i.e., some mice just don't like HFHS food?? is there a reason to????
        
    * change in the reward system induced in higher motivation to obtain palatable food, or innate difference in palatable food preference alters the reward system? egg / chicken problem?
                
    * Lewy body in PD patients migrate from bowel -> the first symptom is constipation, years before the behavioural symptom (the first is loss of olfactory)
    
    * neuronal type is not specified, GABA? glutamate? (Stephenson-Jones 2020) which relate to positive & negative valence (hedonism) respectively
       ** GABAergic neurons have increased activity when the stimuli are appealing, i.e., if GABA neurons become less active & lower resting potential, people will react less to appealing stimuli?????
        Yea that make sense, for after chronic exposure to HFHS food, people need even higher dosage to get to the same level of excitation, like addiction
        
    * Does the FSL difference has something to do with GABA?
    
    * why not perform recording right after chronic HFHS? how would you know what exactly happened to VP? suggestion: add another round of recording right after diet, & keep the 2-week cooling period -> know what happened in that 2-week
    
    * Tbc1d1 gene mutation protects from diet-induced obesity (Chadt et al 2008)
