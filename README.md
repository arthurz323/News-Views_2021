# News-Views_2021 (due on Monday 1 st February 2021)

The assessment is a ‘News and Views’ Essay (1,000 words maximum) plus lay summary (200 words maximum) based on a paper published in The Journal of Neuroscience
in the last year.

## Essay:

The paper should be related to one of the themed weeks listed above and the themed week title should be included on the assignment coversheet.

The word count excludes references and bibliography. 

The minimum font size should be 11pt.

The paper should follow the format of ‘News and Views’ articles in Nature and you should read some ‘News and Views’ articles beforehand.

The paper should not only contain a summary of the original research but should put the research into context with other potentially contrasting findings.

You may want to identify gaps that the research has left in our understanding and experiments could be suggested to resolve issues.

You should include figures and tables were appropriate.

## Lay summary:

Students should prepare a lay summary of the paper (180-200 words), targeted at an intelligent and interested non-scientist.

As each specialist term needs to be explained, it is often not possible to include more than two technical terms in the lay abstract.

An electronic copy must be submitted via LEARN.


## Tips:
### When you are writing an evaluation paragraph use the PEC system:
  
  Make your Point.
  
  Explain how and why the point is relevant.
  
  Discuss the Consequences / implications of the theory or study. Are they positive or negative?

### Using Research Studies in your Essays
Research studies can either be knowledge or evaluation.

If you refer to the procedures and findings of a study, this shows knowledge and understanding.
If you comment on what the studies shows, and what it supports and challenges about the theory in question, this shows evaluation.

### Writing an Introduction
It is often best to write your introduction when you have finished the main body of the essay, so that you have a good understanding to the topic area.

If there is a word count for your essay try to devote 10% of this to your introduction.

Ideally the introduction should:

  Identify the subject of the essay and define the key terms.
  
  Highlight the major issues which “lie behind” the question. Let the reader know how you will focus your essay by identifying the main themes to be discussed.
  
  “Signpost” the essay’s key argument, (and, if possible, how this argument is structured).

Introductions are very important as first impressions count and they can create a halo effect in the mind of the lecturer grading your essay. If you start off well then you are more likely to be forgiven for the odd mistake later one.

### Writing a Conclusion
So many students either forget to write a conclusion or fail to give it the attention it deserves. If there is a word count for your essay try to devote 10% of this to your conclusion.

Ideally the conclusion should summarize the key themes / arguments of your essay. State the take home message – don’t sit on the fence, instead weigh up the evidence presented in the essay and make a decision which side of the argument has more support.

Also, you might like to suggest what future research may need to be conducted and why (read the discussion section of journal articles for this).
Don't include new information / arguments (only information discussed in the main body of the essay).

If you are unsure of what to write read the essay question and answer it in one paragraph.

Points that unite or embrace several themes can be used to great effect as part of your conclusion.

### The Importance of Flow
Obviously, what you write is important, but how you communicate your ideas / arguments has a significant influence on your overall grade. Most students may have similar information / content in their essays, but the better students communicate this information concisely and articulately.

When you have finished the first draft of your essay you must check if it 'flows'. This is an important feature of quality of communication (along with spelling and grammar).

This means that the paragraphs follow a logical order (like the chapters in a novel). Have a global structure with themes arranged in a way that allows for a logical sequence of ideas. You might want to rearrange (cut and paste) paragraphs to a different position in your essay if they don't appear to fit in with the essay structure.

To improve the flow of your essay make sure the last sentence of one paragraph links to first sentence of the next paragraph. This will help the essay flow and make it easier to read.

Finally, only repeat citations when it is unclear which study / theory you are discussing. Repeating citations unnecessarily disrupts the flow of an essay.
