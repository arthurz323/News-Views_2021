    Overeating high-calorie processed food is the main cause of obesity. Though the impact of obesity to the brain is unclear, evidence has pointed out that chronic high-calorie diet alters ventral pallidum (VP), a structure relates to feeding behaviour in the reward system, in a mouse model. Specifically, Gendelis et al. found that: 1) chronic high-fat-high-sugar (HFHS) diet changes the neuronal properties in VP; 2) VP neurons become less active in mice which have gained the most weight; 3) weight-gaining in general relates to weakened ability to suppress inhibitory input, which leads to inactivity of VP and promotes overeating in turn; interestingly, 4) between naive-to-HFHS-food mice with the highest and lowest level of food seeking behaviour, similar pattern of difference seen in 3) is also presented, implying that variation in the ability of inhibitory input suppression maybe innate. These results suggested that VP is critical to chronic high-calorie diet induced obesity, and its innate property...may determine the level of obesity resistance... better understanding the role of reward system & obesity...intervene obesity epidemic...how metaplasticity changes remains unknown
    
    
    (chronic high-calorie diet does alter the reward system; by shutting down VP, the lateral hypothalamus more active...?), further identify its role in future studies is essential. [132 words, more!!!!]

0. what motivate me to write about this paper???
    keywords: palatable food, accessibility, healthy diet (how to define), unhealthy diet (how to define), obesity (worldwide issue)
Q1: comparing HFHS & control, what will HFHS do to VP? any difference between groups?

Q2: within HFHS, difference in weight-gaining have difference in VP neurophysiology?
    Q2.1 electrophysiology
    Q2.2 synaptic plasticity
    
Q3: if Q1 or Q2=true, are neuronal difference (among different amount of weight-gaining) due to diet, or innateness plays a role? i.e., quote: "are these synaptic differences between obesity-prone and weight-gaining-resistant animals the cause or the consequence of obesity?"
    
    
    Processed food is usually attractive and appetising yet calorie-dense; its accessibility and affordability triggers overeating and drives obesity in turn. In 2016, over 2.5 billion people were overweight or obese (ref.); obesity-related diseases have become major causes of death globally. Despite the high prevalence, the biological, especially neurobiological, mechanisms under obesity remain unknown. Studies suggested that the answer may lie in the brain's reward system. Since processed food is too palatable to resist, people often regard it as "treat" which can stimulate the reward system in the brain (Kenny, 2011; de Macedo et.al., 2016). Diet-induced obesity indeed share similar properties with addiction: both may involve pathologies in the reward system (ref.). Therefore, to dissect the intertwinement between diet-induced obesity and the reward system, questions like whether diet-induced obesity alters the reward system, and whether intrinsic properties in the reward system promote weight gaining need to be answered. Writing in *the Journal of Neuroscience*, Gendelis et al. (ref 1) address these questions with electrophysiological techniques in the ventral pallidum (VP), a crucial area in the reward system which also modulates feeding behaviour (ref.), of a mouse model, and report chronic high-calorie diet alters VP neurophysiology, and innate difference in metaplasticity promotes obesity.
    
        
    Neurons convey information electrically and chemically. to understand the property of a brain structure is determined by neuronal properties. electrical & chemical info transmission: AP transmit info -> allows to release neurotransmitter -> next AP; resting membrane potential is important for AP firing; pre-synaptic & post-synaptic -> GABA -> synaptic plasticity (connections among them is continuously changing, thats why we could form new memory and generate new ideas); spontaneous & evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents] mysteries of the change in structures lies in synapses. how are they studied? patch clamp; current & voltage clamp. a powerful tool that applies to anywhere in the nervous system since neuron is the basic unit (electrophysiology tools can assess both neurophysiology and synaptic neurotransmission, just different parameters). squeakily lines contain all secrets of the brain. different pattern of synaptic plasticity is called metaplasticity.

    [do i need to talk about obesity?] [should i talk about processed food?]
    
    VP connects key structures in the reward system, such as nucleus accumbens (NAc), and the main hub that controls the feeding behaviour, lateral hypothalamus (LH), with inhibitory signals: upstream NAc sends inhibitory input to VP, and VP inhibits downstream LH (Root et al., 2015). As the most feeding-relevant area in the reward system, not only the activity level of VP directly influences food consumption, VP also encodes the hedonistic value of food (Smith et al., 2009), yet its role in diet-induced obesity is a blank. Thus, Gendelis et al. applied diet-induced obesity protocol to a mouse model, and measured changes in VP neurophysiology and GABAergic neurotransmission using electrophysiological techniques.
    
        
    Two groups of mice received high-fat-high-sugar (HFHS) food (45% kcal fat) and standard chow food (18% kcal fat) respectively for 10-12 weeks on an unlimited basis, with the HFHS group had two extra weeks of recovery diet (standard chow food) to simulate the "on diet" behaviour after weight gaining in human. Following the diet-induced obesity protocol, the HFHS group was divided into top 33% weight gainers (WGs) and bottom 33% weight gainers (NWGs), and the chow group (naive to HFHS food) was divided into top 33% food seekers (high-seekers) and bottom 33% food seekers (low-seekers) based on their performance in a behavioural task that tests the motivation to gain food. At the end of the behavioural experiment, Gendelis et al. blocked excitatory synaptic transmission and performed *in vitro* whole-cell patch clamp recordings in VP neurons, assessed neuronal excitability, passive membrane properties, and spontaneous and evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents to proxy GABAergic neurotransmission.
    
        
    Gendelis et al. found that even after two weeks of recovery, the alterations in VP neurophysiology brought by chronic HFHS diet and weight-gaining were still present. Comparing to the chow group, VP neurons from the HFHS group were less active, indicated by lower resting membrane potential (V_rest), lower action potential (AP) firing rate, and wider AP waveform. Within the HFHS group, WGs had lower V_rest than NWGs, and the reduction in V_rest was proportional to weight-gaining across the whole HFHS group. Together with longer first-spike latency (FSL) under current steps, VP neurons of WGs were shown to be less excitatory. Strikingly, the direction and amplitude of long-term synaptic plasticity in inhibitory input correlated with weight-gaining across the HFHS group: from long-term potentiation (LTP) in WGs to long-term depression (LTD) in NWGs; i.e., WGs and NWGs varied in metaplasticity. More interestingly, Gendelis et al. found the same pattern of metaplasticity variation between high-seekers and low-seekers from the naive-to-HFHS chow group: from LTP in high-seekers to LTD in low-seekers; suggesting that metaplasticity is an innate property that determines the level of feeding motivation.
    
        
    The work, therefore, denotes that chronic HFHS diet and diet-induced weight-gaining alter VP neurophysiology, and innate difference in VP metaplasticity may mark the proneness to develop obesity. Though the mechanism remain unclear, Gendelis et al. pointed out an intriguing avenue to follow: how does the difference in metaplasticity promote obesity? One possible explanation could be suppressing inhibitory input is a protective ability against HFHS-diet-induced hyperpolarisation that WGs and high-seekers lack, and this "deficit" made them more prone to become obese. Additionally, the importance of collaboration between neuroscientists and gastroenterologists to further explore the brain-gut axis and improve human health as one is again signified. Studies have evidenced that gut health is vital to neurological health (Kemal 2014 Cryan 2020); Parkinson's Disease, albeit neurological, may have its origin in the gut, with gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation present years before the first presence of motor symptom (Liddle 2018, Borghammer 2019). Gendelis and colleagues' finding, too, provides insights in how diet impacts the brain.
    
        
    However, issues shall be minded. The authors. used the term "high-fat-high-sugar" throughout, yet neither the portion of sugar, nor the type of fat, was specified. Given that restricting carbohydrates is critical for preventing and improving obesity (Feinman 2015), and omega-3 fat polyunsaturated fatty acids is beneficial for neurological health (Gallo 2020 & Kamel 2014 & Zhang 2011), clearly define the nutrition facts is essential. Future studies could consider to include other fat-sugar combinations of diet, i.e., high-fat-low-sugar (HFLS), LFHS, and LFLS. Secondly, Gendelis et al. performed neurophysiological recordings only two weeks after the last exposure to HFHS food, as a dynamic system that changes constantly, whatever happened during the recovery period was unknown. Future studies could also consider to perform recordings right after the diet-induced obesity protocol to study the acute response.
    
        
    Connecting diet, weight-gaining, and the reward system, Gendelis and colleagues' work opens several interesting avenues for future research, promises to lead a better understanding of the brain-gut axis.
   
   
   
   
    
     
    
    
    
assessed alteration in GABAergic neurotransmission, by measuring both evoked & spontaneous inhibitory signals from VP neurons, and yes GABAergic neurotransmission is impaired (spontaneous IPSC amplitude drop in HFHS).
    
    
    To follow neuronal changes in VP under obesity context, Gendelis et al. applied diet-induced obesity protocol to a mouse model and used electrophysiological techniques to measure neurophysiology and GABAergic neurotransmission.
    
        
     
     
     
     maybe too much: then brains are sliced & perform in vitro whole-cell patch clamp; as VP receives & sends inhibitory signals both from & to up & downstream structures,➡️ this study focus on the inhibitory signals ➡️ excitatory synaptic transmission is blocked.

4. method in more detail (whole-cell patch clamp, voltage & current)
*excitatory synaptic transmission is #BLOCKED# by CNQX (AMPAR/kainate antagonist)!!!!* -> not looking at the glutamate at all!
* evoked IPSC (~30-70% of the max. IPSC) induced by a bipolar stimulating electrode anterior to the cell

    4.1 current clamp: measures excitability & passive membrane properties
        4.1.1 current step protocol: injection of 500ms depolarising current 0pA-80pA (20pA step); baseline membrane potential adjusted to -50mV by injecting constant current
        
        * spontaneous IPSC recorded for 100s without stimulation
        
    4.2 voltage clamp: hold -80mV, measures synaptic activity
    
    4.3 HFS (high-frequency stimulation) induce plasticity (depression) 
        4.3.1 evoked IPSC baseline measurement (under voltage clamp -80mV), 3mins
        
        4.3.2 HFS: 100 stimulation at 100Hz, with amplitude equals to IPSC baseline, 2 trains separated by 20s
        
        4.3.3 after the 2nd train, voltage clamp -80mV, and record evoked (not spontaneous) IPSC at 0.1Hz, average amplitude of 6 responses to get one data point per minute
        
        4.3.4 short-term synaptic depression (STD): measure PTP (post-tetanic potentiation; a form of short-term plasticity, induces change in *frequency* of **miniature** post-synaptic current/potential but not amplitude) 1min after HFS
        
        4.3.5 long-term synaptic depression (LTD): measure ??? 13-19 min after HFS

        4.4.2 CV (coefficient of variation) of the current: difference between the first peak of two pulses
        
        4.4.3 these two parameters are measured twice: baseline & after HFS, repeated 20 times under each condition; they are indicators of change in the probability of *pre-synaptic* release

*[Something else: **The frequency of the mPSC is dependent upon vesicular release whereas the amplitude of the mPSC is dependent upon activation of the postsynaptic receptor. As an example, if you see a reduction in the frequency of mIPSCs, it is due to a decrease in the release of GABA, while a decrease in the amplitude of mIPSCs is due to reduced activation of postsynaptic GABAA receptors.**
    **"Spontaneous postsynaptic currents are currents generated by action-potential-dependent and –independent release of neurotransmitter in the absence of experimental stimulation. Miniature postsynaptic currents are currents observed in the absence of presynaptic action potentials; they are thought to correspond to the response that is elicited by a single vesicle of transmitter."

5. HFHS & Chow group (more method stuff which leads directly to the finding)
    5.1 passive neuronal properties (measured 2 weeks after HFHS)
        5.1.1 V_rest: HFHS ⬇️
        
        5.1.2 AP firing rate: HFHS ⬇️
        
        5.1.3 first-spike latency (FSL): no difference
        
        5.1.4 AP waveform: HFHS wider
            AP half-width ⬆️
            AP rise time ⬆️
            membrane resistance ⬆️
            current injected to maintain at -50mV ⬇️ (i.e., closer to -50mV, tho still >-50mV)
    ➡️ chronic HFHS changed VP neuron physiology

    5.2 GABA transmission
        5.2.1 spontaneous IPSC amplitude: HFHS ⬇️
        
        5.2.2 spontaneous IPSC frequency: no difference
    ➡️ change in GABA transmission, less likely due to pre-synaptic properties change, since PPR & CV of evoked IPSC did not change
    
        5.2.3 evidence from synaptic plasticity (induced depression)
            a. STD (ms): 5 identical pulses (1Hz, 10Hz, 50Hz), record change (divide each evoked IPSC by the first one, i.e., ratio of IPSC_n/IPSC_1) in evoked IPSC; no difference in evoked IPSC frequency between groups
            ➡️ no STD induced
            
            b. LTD (min): used HFS protocol as above, no difference between groups
            ➡️ no LTD induced
    ➡️ chronic HFHS impairs spontaneous neurotransmission through a post-synaptic mechanism, yet it does NOT change STD & LTD of evoked GABA transmission
    
➡️ #BIG point 1: HFHS changes VP neuron physiology



6. WG & NWG (no difference in baseline weight)
    6.1 passive neuronal properties (measured 2 weeks after HFHS)
        6.1.1 V_rest: WG ⬇️; negatively correlated with weight-gaining across the *ENTIRE HFHS* group!!
        
        6.1.2 AP firing rate: no difference
        
        6.1.3 first-spike latency (FSL): WG ⬆️
        
        6.1.4 AP waveform: no difference
            AP rise time ⬆️
    ➡️ comparing to NWG, VP neurons in WG are more hyper-polarised & slower to fire AP, i.e., less excitatory
    
    6.2 synaptic plasticity
        6.2.1 spontaneous IPSC (amplitudes & frequency): no difference
        
        6.2.2 evoked IPSC (again HFS protocol; 10 & 50Hz)
            a. ST (ratio of IPSC_n/IPSC_1): WG ⬆️ (Fig. 4D)
            ➡️ STP (short-term potentiation!!) induced in WG
            
            b. LT (IPSC amplitude): WG ⬆️, lasted for ~15min; transient NWG ⬇️ but *non-sig*!!
            ➡️ LTP (long-term potentiation!!) induced in WG, and correlated with weight-gaining across *ALL MICE*!! Transforming from LTD in NWG & LTP in WG!!!

        6.2.3 PTP: WG > NWG ➡️ tendency of strengthening inhibitory input (i.e., getting more and more inactive)
        
➡️ #BIG point 2: comparing to NWG, VP neurons in WG has: 1. V_rest ⬇️, FSL ⬆️; 2. STP & LTP after HFS, while NWG has LTD; 3. reduction of V_rest inversely relates to weight-gaining across HFHS; 4. LTP relates weight-gaining across ALL MICE.



7. it is **weight-gaining** that matters to VP physiology, not weight-loss
    7.1 BUT! here comes the issue: measurement made after chronic HFHS & weight-gaining, and the weight-loss is dropping to the baseline, i.e., "back to normal" NOT pathological. thus, it is not weight-gaining or losing per say, but the whether it is pathological.
        quote: "*the physiology of the VP is **more linked** to the consumption of highly palatable food and not to the abstinence from it*" 

➡️ This does NOT sound feasible, as their weights are getting back to normal! Only assessing change of weight can NOT make such conclusion!



8. innateness of synaptic plasticity difference between WG & NWG
    8.1 parameters seeking: the thing changed by chronic diet change, but not HFHS itself ➡️ FSL & synaptic plasticity (SP)
    
    8.2 training chow mice (progression ratio task (some willing to make extra effort for a piece of reward, i.e., stronger motivation to get food, as oppose to ones that gave up very early on), reward is CHOW FOOD!)
        8.2.1 HSe (top 33%)
        
        8.2.2 LSe (bottom 33%)
    
    8.3 FSL & STSP: no difference; different from WG & NWG (see 6.1.3 & 6.2.2a)
    ➡️ differences in FSL & STSP are NOT innate, but induced by HFHS

    8.4 LTSP
        8.4.1 evoked IPSC amplitudes: HSe ⬆️, LSe ⬇️; i.e., *LTP in HSe, LTD in LSe*, *similar to WG & NWG results* (see 6.2.2b)
        
        8.4.2 LTSP lasted longer in seekers than after diet modification (HFHS & Chow), presumably bc HFHS already made the modification to VP, thus the effect of extra HFS has only limited impact (just a wild guess...)
        
    8.5 PTP: HSe > LSe, *similar to WG & NWG results* (see 6.2.3)

➡️ #BIG point 3: *proneness* to (HFS-induced) inhibitory input LTP to VP is an innate property that may partially be the cause of extreme weight gaining, i.e., VP are more likely to strengthen inhibitory input

    9.3 HSe & LSe test innateness
        9.3.1 differences in FSL & STSP are NOT innate but induced by HFHS
        
        9.3.2 difference in LTSP may be innate, as HSe & LSe demonstrated differences WITHOUT exposure to HFHS
        
        9.3.3 difference in PTP may also be innate
    ➡️ #BIG point 3: *proneness* to (HFS-induced) inhibitory input LTP to VP is an innate property that may partially be the cause of extreme weight gaining, i.e., VP are more likely to strengthen inhibitory input
    i.e., VP neurons play a role in weight-gaining, individual differences in VP neuron properties may results in different outcome



10. discussion
    10.1 mechanism

        10.1.2 LTD to GABAergic input may act as a compensation against hyperpolarisation in VP induced by HFHS diet, WG & HSe lack the ability to weaken the inhibitory input to VP, ➡️ they are more prone to become obese

        the combination of high sugar & fat rather than high fat contributes to obesity -> introduce HFLS, LFHS, LFLS groups, and specify the type of fat & sugar (free or complex?) -> specify the role of each component -> better translate to human diet design, & understanding of obesity & reward system

       ** GABAergic neurons have increased activity when the stimuli are appealing, i.e., if GABA neurons become less active & lower resting potential, people will react less to appealing stimuli?????
        Yea that make sense, for after chronic exposure to HFHS food, people need even higher dosage to get to the same level of excitation, like addiction
        
    * Does the FSL difference has something to do with GABA?
    
    * why not perform recording right after chronic HFHS? how would you know what exactly happened to VP? suggestion: add another round of recording right after diet, & keep the 2-week cooling period -> know what happened in that 2-week
