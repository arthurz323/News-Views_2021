# News-Views_2021 (due on Monday 1 st February 2021)

The assessment is a ‘News and Views’ Essay (1,000 words maximum) plus lay summary (200 words maximum) based on a paper published in The Journal of Neuroscience
in the last year.

## Essay:

The paper should be related to one of the themed weeks listed above and the themed week title should be included on the assignment coversheet.

The word count excludes references and bibliography. 

The minimum font size should be 11pt.

The paper should follow the format of ‘News and Views’ articles in Nature and you should read some ‘News and Views’ articles beforehand.

The paper should not only contain a summary of the original research but should put the research into context with other potentially contrasting findings.

You may want to identify gaps that the research has left in our understanding and experiments could be suggested to resolve issues.

You should include figures and tables were appropriate.

## Lay summary:

Students should prepare a lay summary of the paper (180-200 words), targeted at an intelligent and interested non-scientist.

As each specialist term needs to be explained, it is often not possible to include more than two technical terms in the lay abstract.

An electronic copy must be submitted via LEARN.


## Tips:
When you are writing an evaluation paragraph use the PEC system:
  
  Make your Point.
  
  Explain how and why the point is relevant.
  
  Discuss the Consequences / implications of the theory or study. Are they positive or negative?
