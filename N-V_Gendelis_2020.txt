# Main (800-1000):

0. what motivate me to write about this paper???
    keywords: palatable food, accessibility, healthy diet (how to define), unhealthy diet (how to define), obesity (worldwide issue)



1. introduce the (existing) problem the article tackled
    1.1 relatable example (e.g.,):
        1.1.1 Recall the last time you had "comfort food"/doughnut/fried chicken/chocolate/candy, craving! Why? Not that you need them to keep you alive,but it makes you feel good.
        
        * in 2016, over 650 million adults were obese, and over 340 million children & adolescents were overweight or obese (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight), and obesity-related diseases have become leading cause of death worldwide.
        
        1.1.2 (or) Why doughnut/fried chicken/chocolate/candy are hard to resist?
        
        1.1.3 (or) Does food choice only about "will power" or there are actual/physiological changes in your brain? i.e., gaining weight is just bc one lacks "will power"?
    
    1.2 high-calorie diet esp. processed palatable food are easily accessible, induced obesity, which is a pressing problem (give WHO data here)
    
    1.3 existing problem
        1.3.1 existing studies showed diet-induced obesity can change the brain, but where? what? how? unknown
        
        1.3.2 pointing to the reward system, similar to addiction, NAc esp., and introduce ventral pallidum, lack of study in this region
        
        1.3.3 Are some more likely to gain weight than others? i.e., some people are more susceptible to choose palatable food ( which leads to gain excessive weight) given the same diet? i.e., innate/personal difference?



2. introduce diet-induced obesity & its relationship with reward system, esp VP, its role in pathological overeating (*is the overeating here really pathological????) & obesity has not been studied
    2.1 gives rise to the pos. of involving growth factor in PD
    
    2.2 gradually reason to introducing growth factor into adult brain to treat PD

3. method in the article
    3.1 electrophysiology
    
    3.2 HFHS diet
    
    3.3 justification of choosing the method -> functionality/properties change at the neuronal level in VP from the difference in diet (mention chronic here!)



4. method in more detail (whole-cell patch clamp, voltage & current)
* excitatory synaptic transmission is #BLOCKED#!!!! -> not looking at the glutamate at all!
* evoked IPSC (~30-70% of the max. IPSC) induced by a bipolar stimulating electrode anterior to the cell
* groups
    HFHS (10-12 weeks)
        WG (weight-gainer, upper 33%)
        NWG (not weight-gainer, lower 33%)
    chow
        HR (reach out for HFHS reward, upper 33%)
        LR (not reach out for HFHS reward, lower 33%)

    4.1 current clamp: measures excitability & passive membrane properties
        4.1.1 current step protocol: injection of 500ms depolarising current 0pA-80pA (20pA step); baseline membrane potential adjusted to -50mV by injecting constant current
        
        * spontaneous IPSC recorded for 100s without stimulation
        
    4.2 voltage clamp: hold -80mV, measures synaptic activity
    
    4.3 HFS (high-frequency stimulation) induce plasticity (depression) 
        4.3.1 evoked IPSC baseline measurement (under voltage clamp -80mV), 3mins
        
        4.3.2 HFS: 100 stimulation at 100Hz, with amplitude equals to IPSC baseline, 2 trains separated by 20s
        
        4.3.3 after the 2nd train, voltage clamp -80mV, and record evoked (not spontaneous) IPSC at 0.1Hz, average amplitude of 6 responses to get one data point per minute
        
        4.3.4 short-term synaptic depression (STSD): measure PTP (post-tetanic potentiation; a form of short-term plasticity, induces change in #frequency# of post-synaptic current/potential, no change in amplitude) 1min after HFS
        
        4.3.5 long-term synaptic depression (LTSD): measure ??? 13-19 min after HFS
        
    4.4 consecutive pulses*2 with 50ms interval
        4.4.1 PPR (paired-pulse ration): amplitude of second pulse/amplitude of first pulse (i.e., ratio of two amplitudes) for each group
        
        4.4.2 CV (coefficient of variation) of the current: difference between the first peak of two pulses
        
        4.4.3 these two parameters are measured twice: baseline & after HFS, repeated 20 times under each condition; they are indicators of change in the probability of #pre-synaptic# release



5. more method stuff which leads directly to the finding
    5.1 passive neuronal properties (measured 2 weeks after HFHS)
        5.1.1 resting membrane potential: HFHS ⬇️
        
        5.1.2 AP firing rate: HFHS ⬇️
        
        5.1.3 first-spike latency (FSL): no difference
        
        5.1.4 AP waveform: HFHS wider
            AP half-width ⬆️
            AP rise time ⬆️
            membrane resistance ⬆️
            current injected to maintain at -50mV ⬇️ (i.e., closer to -50mV, tho still >-50mV)
    ➡️ chronic HFHS changed VP neuron physiology

    5.2 GABA transmission
        5.2.1 spontaneous IPSC amplitude: HFHS ⬇️
        
        5.2.2 spontaneous IPSC frequency: no difference
    ➡️ change in GABA transmission, less likely due to pre-synaptic properties change, since PPR & CV of evoked IPSC did not change
    
        5.2.3 evidence from synaptic plasticity (depression)
            a. STSD (ms): 5 identical pulses (1Hz, 10Hz, 50Hz), record change (divide each evoked IPSC by the first one) in evoked IPSC; no difference in evoked IPSC frequency between groups
            ➡️ no STSD induced
            
            b. LTSD (min): used HFS protocol as above, no difference between groups
            ➡️ no LTSD induced

6. finding (neuronal integration)
    6.1 importance of understanding the biology of each developmental stage
    6.2 thus the delivery timing mattered
    6.3 the future of using GDNF is bright, if timing is optimised
    6.4 and this timing is comparable to other animals, e.g., rodent & primate
    
7. other limitation of current approaches, which is resolved by this new approaches
    7.1 author used fluorescent to address this issue -> sig. improvement

8. views from Studer
    8.1 significance again in one sentence
    8.2 future challenge identified by author, i.e., limitations

9. views from Studer
    9.1 follows previous limitations, further identify issues, i.e., if GDNF is enough
    9.2 what are the possible solution to these issues

10.1 situation of introducing 9.2 into PD (how it is applicable)
10.2 another benefit of using this new approach

11. summary & views
    11.1 significance of this paper
    11.2 pre-caution
    11.3 bright future of GDNF
    
11.* views
    * collaboration between neuroscientists & Gastroenterologists, i.e., brain-gut axis
    
    * about the diet itself
        sugar (diabetes use high fat low sugar diet, its about the balance of insulin -> control carbs, i.e., free sugar) INSULIN RESISTANCE is the term!!
        what fat? saturated? unsaturated? trans?
        Pennetta lipid droplets, high fat diet improve ALS
        the combination of high sugar & fat rather than high fat contributes to obesity -> introduce HFLS, LFHS, LFLS groups, and specify the type of fat & sugar (free or complex?) -> specify the role of each component -> better translate to human diet design, & understanding of obesity & reward system
        
    * change in the reward system induced in higher motivation to obtain palatable food, or innate difference in palatable food preference alters the reward system? egg / chicken problem?
                
    * Lewy body in PD patients migrate from bowel -> the first symptom is constipation, years before the behavioural symptom (the first is loss of olfactory)
    
    * neuronal type is not specified, GABA? glutamate? (Stephenson-Jones 2020) which relate to positive & negative valence respectively
       ** GABAergic neurons have increased activity when the stimuli are appealing, i.e., if GABA neurons become less active & lower resting potential, people will react less to appealing stimuli?????
        Yea that make sense, for after chronic exposure to HFHS food, people need even higher dosage to get to the same level of excitation, like addiction
        
    * Does the FSL difference has something to do with GABA?
    
    * why not perform recording right after chronic HFHS? how would you know what exactly happened to VP? suggestion: add another round of recording right after diet, & keep the 2-week cooling period -> know what happened in that 2-week
    
    * Tbc1d1 gene mutation protects from diet-induced obesity (Chadt et al 2008)
    
    * the leap from reward system to decision making
